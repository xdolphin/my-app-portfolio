# my-app-portfolio
This is the first app for leanring from udacity.It is a simple demo with some buttons which will show toasts when clicked.

There is a little question need to be writed here.When I clean the project,I find the `gradle clean` task is not in the 
app->tasks->vertification->clean,it is here:app-tasks-build-clean. I dont know if the two `clean` task work same.
